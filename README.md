# NS-3 Composite Energy Model for UAVs and Satellites

## Overview

This project implements a **Composite Energy Model** within the **ns-3** simulation framework, tailored for **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)** and **Satellites**. The model allows UAVs to operate solely on battery power, while Satellites can also harvest energy from solar panels, simulating a **Low Earth Orbit (LEO)** topology.

## Features

- **Battery-Powered UAVs:** Simulates energy consumption during transmission, reception, and idle states.
- **Solar-Harvesting Satellites:** Combines battery power with periodic energy replenishment from solar panels.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extendable to accommodate additional energy models or node types.
- **Comprehensive Examples:** Includes simulation scripts demonstrating usage scenarios.
- **Unit Testing:** For reliability and correctness of energy models through automated tests.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **ns-3:** Version 3.30 or later.
- **C++ Compiler:** Compatible with ns-3 requirements.
- **Build Tools:** `waf`, `g++`, `make`, etc.
- **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ns3-composite-energy-model.git
   cd ns3-composite-energy-model
   ```

2. **Integrate with ns-3:**

   Copy the `src/`, `examples/`, and other directories into your ns-3 installation's root directory.

   ```bash
   cp -r src/ <path-to-ns3>/src/
   cp -r examples/ <path-to-ns3>/examples/
   cp -r tests/ <path-to-ns3>/tests/
   cp -r docs/ <path-to-ns3>/docs/
   cp -r scripts/ <path-to-ns3>/scripts/
   cp -r .github/ <path-to-ns3>/.github/
   ```

3. **Update `wscript`:** (waf)

   Ensure that ns-3 recognizes the new energy models by updating the `wscript` file in the `src/energy/` directory.

   ```python
   # src/energy/wscript

   def build(bld):
        # Add the new composite energy source into the existing energy library
        bld.source += [ 'src/energy/CompositeEnergySource.cc' ]
        bld.includes += [ 'src/energy' ]

       bld.ns3_add_executable("composite-energy-model-example",
                              ["../examples/energy/composite-energy-model-example.cc"],
                              ["energy"],
                              includes=["../examples/energy"],
                              )
   ```

4. **Attributes (LEO cycle):**

   The `ns3::CompositeEnergySource` exposes attributes to model a LEO sunlight/umbra cycle:

   - `UseLeoCycle` (bool, default true): enable sunlight/shadow cycling
   - `PanelAreaM2` (double): solar panel area in m^2
   - `PanelEfficiency` (double): panel efficiency [0..1]
   - `SolarConstantWm2` (double): solar constant (default 1361 W/m^2)
   - `HarvestIntervalSeconds` (double): integration step for harvesting in seconds
   - `SunlightSeconds` (double): sunlight duration per cycle (s)
   - `ShadowSeconds` (double): shadow duration per cycle (s)

   Alternatively, a fixed harvesting window can be set via `AddSolarPanel(powerJps, start, end)` with `UseLeoCycle=false`.

5. **Build the Project:**

   Navigate to the ns-3 root directory and build the project.

   ```bash
   ./waf configure --enable-examples --enable-tests
   ./waf build
   ```

6. **Run Example Simulations:**

   Execute the example simulation to verify the setup.

   ```bash
   ./waf --run energy/composite-energy-model-example

### Example snippet

```cpp
Ptr<CompositeEnergySource> ces = CreateObject<CompositeEnergySource>();
ces->AddBattery(battery);
ces->SetAttribute("UseLeoCycle", BooleanValue(true));
ces->SetAttribute("PanelAreaM2", DoubleValue(2.0));
ces->SetAttribute("PanelEfficiency", DoubleValue(0.28));
ces->SetAttribute("SunlightSeconds", DoubleValue(3900.0));
ces->SetAttribute("ShadowSeconds", DoubleValue(1800.0));
```
   ```
